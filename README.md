# Object Recognition

## Data

The object recognition task was performed using CIFAR-100 dataset which can be downloaded from [here](http://www.cs.toronto.edu/~kriz/cifar.html)
This repository uses CIFAR-10 dataset. Convolutional Neural Networks are implemented using keras and TensorFlow. The accuracy obtained with 10 epochs is around 65 percent. With more number of epochs, the accuracy can become comparable to human accuracy
